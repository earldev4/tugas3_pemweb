                        Invaders from another world attack without warning, unleashing a new type of threat: weapons
                        known
                        as “machine lifeforms.” In the face of this insurmountable threat, mankind is driven from Earth
                        and
                        takes refuge on the Moon. <br>

                        their
                        planet. To break the deadlock, the Resistance deploys a new unit of android infantry: YoRHa .

                        that
                        is soon to unveil the long-forgotten truth of this world...</p>
